# IrisClassifierUsing_SVM
PROBLEM STATEMENT: Prepare SVM model for classifying iris flowers for iris flower data

Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection. The advantages of support vector machines are: Effective in high dimensional spaces. Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.
